# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.Load Data Import and prepare the dataset to initiate the analysis workflow.

2.Explore Data Examine the data to understand key patterns, distributions, and feature relationships.

3.Select Features Choose the most impactful features to improve model accuracy and reduce complexity.

4.Split Data Partition the dataset into training and testing sets for validation purposes.

5.Scale Features Normalize feature values to maintain consistent scales, ensuring stability during training.

6.Train Model with Hyperparameter Tuning Fit the model to the training data while adjusting hyperparameters to enhance performance.

7.Evaluate Model Assess the model’s accuracy and effectiveness on the testing set using performance metrics.
